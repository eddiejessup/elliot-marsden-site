(Note: this is poorly researched.)

I always thought it strange how powerful the clergy seemed when reading history; I just assumed it was power coming from actual respect for religion, rather than them also being a tangibly large force. But thinking more about it, when church is a big part of almost everyone's life, serving them is quite a labour intensive activity!

I was reading about the French revolution, when I learned there were of order 100,000 Catholic clergy in France in 1789, 240 French people per Catholic clergy. For some vague kind of context, In the UK in 2012 there were around 18,000 ordained Church of England clergy, which means around 3,600 UK people per Church of England clergy.

Apparently, 740,000 people attended Church of England Sunday Service each week in the UK in 2016, which implies around 41 Sunday Service attendees per Church of England clergy in the 2010s. At this ratio we could serve 4,100,000 French Catholics, so about 17% of the overall French population in 1789. I'm guessing, though I'm not certain, that this is considerably lower than the share of practising Catholics at that time. Are 2010s Church of England clergy less productive at providing religion than 1789 French Catholic clergy?
